## [Project 1: Redcross Donor Analysis: Project Overview](https://github.com/dcw8161/Redcross-Donor-Analysis)

* Created the classification model that estimate the Redcross donor indicator that guide the client to allocate their limited resources more efficiently by contacting the most positive prospects
* Visualized the data using Tableau and SweetViz for analysis process
* Feautre engineered by
   * Feature scaling for continuous variables: Normalization method (zscore) was used in PyCaret 
   * Encoding for categorical variables: Encoding was done by PyCaret
   * Simple imputation was used in PyCaret set up
   * Anomalies were found using the PyCaret Anomaly detection.
* Analyzed using different methods,
   * Auto ML with PyCaret
   * H2O AI packeage for Advanced Ml and Deep Learning packages
   * Azure-ML
