## [Project 1: Redcross Donor Analysis: Project Overview](https://github.com/dcw8161/Redcross-Donor-Analysis)

* Created the classification model that estimates the Redcross donor indicator that guide the client to allocate their limited resources more efficiently by contacting the most positive prospects
* Visualized the data using Tableau and SweetViz for analysis process
* Feautre engineering by
   * Feature scaling for continuous variables: Normalization method (zscore) was used in PyCaret 
   * Encoding for categorical variables: Encoding was done by PyCaret
   * Simple imputation was used in PyCaret setup
   * Anomalies were found using the PyCaret Anomaly detection.
* Analyzed using different methods,
   * Auto ML with PyCaret
   * H2O AI packeage for Advanced Ml and Deep Learning packages
   * Azure-ML

## [Project 3: Texas Highschool Performance: Project Overview](https://github.com/dcw8161/Texas-High-School-Data-Analysis)

* Built a regression model to predicts the performance of the Texas Highschools as a guide to get an ideal about school performace for future years
* Visualized the data using Tableau and SweetViz for analysis process
* Feature engineering by
    * Feature scaling for continuous variables:  Min-Max Scaling was performed for the continuous variables
    * Encoding for categorical variables: Categorical variables were encoded using One-Hot encoding
    * New feature, Consecutive_G, was created by summing up PrevFYGiving, PrevFY1Giving, PrevFY2Giving, PrevFY3Giving, PrevFY4Giving, and CurrFYGiving by considering visualizations
    * Outliers were calculated using the percentile method
    * Anomalies were found using the PyCaret Anomaly detection
* Analyzed using different methods,
   * Auto ML with PyCaret
   * H2O AI packeage for Advanced Ml and Deep Learning packages
   * Azure-ML
